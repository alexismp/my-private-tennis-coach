coming to us from matthew today i find myself struggling with having a single strategy and actually having a plan with each point i go into in college that sounds like a college player here i feel like i'm just going out there without any intention or a game plan so something involving that would be great all right matthew perfect i'm going to give you a like a very specific like exact game plan that you should have as a singles player specifically this is so critical that you don't just go out there and wing it which most tennis players are doing and i just want to congratulate you for just being honest and coming forward with this question look at the uh the four you know thumbs up here in a short period of time a lot of people resonate with this and that's because a lot of players are going out there without a plan so the plan a i'm about to give you is based on geometry and margin for error and this is why this is data over a million points analyzed from a big thank you to warren at tennisanalytics.net what you're looking at here is a chart for men and for what they broke it into male female and from levels ntrp 3040 to national level juniors in the 12s national level juniors in the 14s 16s 18s ncaa competitors and in professional players and so you see the corresponding numbers here this is the number of errors to winners so at the 304 level men and women are making more than four unforced errors for every winner that they hit i'm sorry let me let me adjust that four 304-0 players are making more than four errors it's combining four stairs and on four stairs just to be really clear for every winner that they hit if you're national level junior you're making between three and four if you're up close to college age you're making a little bit less than three errors per winner if you're a college player a little bit less than that if you're a professional tennis player between two and you know about two and a half or so errors for every winner that you hit so the vast majority of points for tennis players of all levels but especially normal tennis players you know like us we're making four to five times more mistakes than we are hitting a winning shot that's a shot that bounces twice without our opponent even getting to it or touching it so for that reason we have to be very conscious and cognizant of picking patterns that minimize our chances of making a mistake that should kind of be the foundation of a of a good strategy so on the baseline most of the time you should hit cross courts i'm going to go through this relatively quickly there's a lot of coaching on this out there but there's one thing i'm really going to focus on the net is lower when you hit cross-courts the court is longer when you hit cross-courts timing is easier we'll talk about this a little bit i'm about to go to a strategy board when you hit cross-court compared to receiving a cross-court shot and then changing direction and going down the line hitting the ball back where it came from is easier all other things being equal you run less this is what we're gonna talk about and look at when you hit cross courts and you attempt you tempt your opponent to break all of those things when you hit cross court a lot meaning if you stay on a cross court pattern let's say that the the ball is traveling this direction a lot back and forth back and forth every time you if if this is you on this side every time you send the ball back in this direction your average tennis player is going to be very tempted to try this shot especially after the second time the third time the fourth time you give them the opportunity they're going to be kind of licking their chops at a certain point and just trying it because it's visually appealing it's tactically appealing like we kind of want that highlight shot and so players are really tempted by it so let's say we do hit a ball cross court and our opponent gets a forehand the right-handed player on the other side these green x's represent kind of the two far most targets that they could aim for all the way down the line as close to the line as possible and a sharp ang angle that exits the court after it hits the courts the reason why this third line is drawn is to represent the middle of those two potential shots that that they could try so when the ball is on the left side you should be a little bit on the right side when you're on the baseline so that means when you're receiving a ball on this side of the court and you're getting ready for a forehand you basically have the option of saying okay i'm going to take this this shot and hit it this direction which means now where are you going to have to recover if you hit the ball from here to here now your recovery spot is on this red x instead of the first one so in effect you're doubling the amount of running you have to do immediately following that shot that's huge that's really significant so based on your decision if you hit the ball here you half the amount of running if you hit the ball here you double the amount of running so over the span of an entire tennis match this is really really significant and so it's not just geometry when you hit this way you've got more room for error over the net you have more room for air inside the baseline but you also minimize the amount of work that you have to do and when you hit cross court a lot and you tempt your opponent to hit down the line now you're tempting them to make that bad decision and when they do make it now you have the opportunity to run them twice as much because of that decision that they made now when you're at the net it flips and i'm going to show you why in a second a lot of most people don't understand this it flips completely when you're at the net it's the opposite when you keep the ball in front of you instead of hitting at a diagonal you have more time to respond i'll show you why in a second you hit yourself into position instead of out of position you run less and you give your opponent smaller targets to aim for when you keep the ball in front of you when you're at the net when you're already at the net so let me show you why part of the reason why i drew this middle line is to illustrate something let's say that instead of being at the baseline we're at the net and so you approach and come up to the net and put yourself right in the center of the net because you know you want to cover that cross-court passing shot but you also want to cover that down the line passing shot so look at these look at these angles look at that look at the yellow lines is this person actually in the center of the possible passing shots from the other person look at how much space is available in this direction to hit past that net player versus how much space is available this way to hit past the net person the net person's in the middle but the middle is not actually the middle anymore look at how this line traces and eventually crosses over the middle of the court and now it's on the same side of the court as the ball so here's a really good rule of thumb when you're at the net in singles you should be on the same side of the court as the ball and the further over the ball is the further over you should be to account for this spread of angles it flips on the baseline because of how this geometry works all the way back at the baseline you want to be on the other side of the court so on the baseline you should be opposite on the right side of the court when the ball is on the left and at the net you should be on the left side of the court when the ball is on the left so that's why everything is flipped if you receive a volley here and you angle it over there well where do i need to get to next before my opponent hits that next passing shot i need to get all the way over to this side of the court and because you're at the net your amount of time to respond is really really low so if you hit this volley and you can't get all the way over here before your opponent gets to the ball well you just left an easy target you made more running for yourself and so your job being a good tennis player becomes dramatically more complicated and more difficult here's the here's your plan a for every match this is this is your mindset is your strategy and your your playbook every time you begin a singles match from the baseline based on everything we just talked about hit the ball cross court unless you have a good reason to hit down the line so good reason might be well my opponent's best shot is cross court so every time i get a forehand and i hit them beforehand they just hit a winner okay that's a good reason to avoid that big strength or maybe they're really out of position and so they're leaving a huge chunk of court open down the line okay good reason to go down the line maybe you're receiving a short ball and you're going to be approaching or attacking that can be a really good reason to go down the line but there has to be a good reason otherwise remember that that big list of things otherwise all of these things are working against you so there has to be a good enough reason to counteract all of these things and then you can go down the line and a lot of times it's there but most of the time it's not most of the time you should be hitting cross court so that's from the baseline and at the net based on everything we just talked about keep the ball in front of you unless you have a good reason to hit away from yourself aka cross court so if you're receiving a low volley or let's say an approach shot you haven't made your way all the way up to the net yet in an attacking position if you don't have an offensive attacking opportunity then you should keep the ball on the same side of the court that you're on otherwise all of those challenging factors are coming into play so matthew hopefully that makes sense hopefully this really kind of simplifies things for you and really gives you a starting point you know for all your matches from here on out
