            "description": "Improve your winner-to-unforced error ratio by focusing on consistent, controlled shots that force errors rather than aiming for outright winners. This approach is more sustainable for winning matches, as it increases the chances of your opponent making mistakes while minimizing yours.",

            "description": "Track your forced errors to improve aggression and risk management. Keep track of how many aggressive shots you hit that made your opponent miss, without necessarily resulting in outright winners. This data highlights effective strategies to maintain aggressive play while mitigating unnecessary risks.",

            "description": "Analyze your win probabilities for different shot selections, considering confounding factors like shot depth, direction and speed. By doing so, you can avoid drawing the wrong conclusions from raw statistics and understand when certain tactics are deceptively more or less effective than they seem.",
