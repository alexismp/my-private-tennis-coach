hey guys Brady here with your daily tennis lesson so we're checking out stats this week it's stat week at Daily tennis lesson partially because the Australian open's going on and there's just so many cool stats being thrown out with every match that you see all right so today what we're going to look at are these overrated stats in my book and the first being the amount of winners that you guys want to hit or are trying to hit in any given match all right so in a two out of three set match if you guys win 48 points you feasibly win the match I think none of us are ever going out and hitting 48 winners in a two out of three set match so that to me is the reason why we need to look a little closer at the IDE between you know unforced errors and winners and for me that basically just bumps up your guys level of consistency and it makes you a smarter player because if I need to win 48 points is there a chance that my opponent could make 25 or 30 unforced errors sure and at that rate how many winners do I need factor in that we've done a a video this week on forc erors I might need only 10 or 15 winners combined with some forced errors and then some unforced errors from my opponent to win the match and it makes it a much better outlook for what is required of me to go out and play great tennis where if I if I step on the court and think I need winners to beat this guy that is a very low percentage brand of tennis so let's kind of clear our heads of the winner idea and let's start blending it with our winner to un forced error ratio all right secondly we're looking at Aces and I get it aces are fun to hit I love Aces but you guys have to remember if you guys are going for Ace after Ace after Ace and let's say you hit 10 aces in a match that's a great number but what if the result of getting 10 aces in a match was that your first serve percentage was 19% you are losing that match I guarant it and granted you can go home and go honey I hit 10 Aces today all right well how'd you do in the match well I lost 6164 hopefully the the game we are after is a game where Aces improve our chances of winning it's not the end all Beall so let's try to factor in a little more of the first serve percentage that we're making at the end of the match and I think you know you guys have heard me talk about this this before we did a video this week where if you guys are making 60 to 70% of your first serves that formula is getting you much more on track with winning matches where if we're just hyperfocused on Aces we're going to lose a lot you guys and it's a flashy way to lose but it's still losing all right so let's look at that higher percentage of first serves made rather than the aat all right and third we are looking at at the miles per hour on the first serve you look at any of these Pros playing at the Australian Open they got the speed gun sitting right behind the court and every time these guys hit a serve where do our eyes go we check out hey how fast did he hit that it's a really cool thing to know how fast you hit your serve Federer versus rodic is a great pairing right there when we're talking about the difference between sheer power and work the Box Federer Ser is not as fast as rodic was but every time you saw them play rodic struggled way more on his return to serve than Federer did because of Federer's ability to be accurate still with plenty of power feder hits the ball 125 milph that's not a slouch serve but his placement is fantastic where rodic was a lot of times just trying to go through the opponent all right so let's kind of tone it down down with how fast we think we're trying to hit and let's replace that with the idea of placement in the box and start to get this serve testing our opponents on all aspects of their return all right so those are my stats for the day I think they're compare and contrast obviously that is my two cents I think you guys would see a ton of help in your game if you go out with those three new focuses um in those three areas okay so that's all I got for you guys today please click like below this video and if you have not subscribed to our Channel yet please do so as well as check out any of our three courses you guys I think they uh are going to be a ton of help for you you can find them directly below me in the description of this video that you're currently watching um and until next time enjoy and we'll see you soon n
