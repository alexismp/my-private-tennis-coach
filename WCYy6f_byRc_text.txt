before i get into anything that is specific to tennis i'm going to start with a non-tennis story about the theme of today's webinar which is the importance of correctly interpreting statistics so this is the story of dr abraham wald dr wall was a statistician who worked for the allies in world war ii and he was given a very specific task by the military officers so what he was shown were a bunch of planes that had come back from combat and these planes had bullet holes in them because they had been fired upon by the axis powers and military officers told dr walt that they wanted to increase the amount of armor to protect the planes from bullets the issue though is that too much armor and the planes will be too heavy to fly so dr wall is being tasked with looking at the patterns of the bullets which are essentially statistics to determine what's the best place for the armor to go and if you look here at the plane it's uh pictured on this slide you look at all the bullet holes you'll notice that there's a lot of bullet holes in the body of the plane and there's a lot of bullet holes in the wing tips but what you don't see are any bullet holes on the engines because that's exactly what dr walt saw there were virtually no bullet holes on the engines so kind of the most intuitive thing right when you what you first think is that you would want to put the armor where the bullet holes are that way you'll best protect the plane but dr wall didn't just stop there he thought for a second essentially asking himself why is it that the patterns of bullet holes are the way they are and he realized something which is that the planes that he got to see were not all the planes that had come back from combat and if you think about it and the axis powers are firing bullets up into the sky i mean they're not snipers they're not specifically targeting parts of the plane they're just firing bullets up there and whatever they hit they hit so why is that the engines are seemingly not getting hit well what if they actually are getting hit and what's happening is that the planes that get hit in the engines are just crashing so they don't come back from combat and dr wall never gets to see him so what dr walt realized is that the initial intuitive hypothesis that the armor should go where the bullet holes are is actually not correct and in fact the armor should go where the bullet holes aren't on the engines and the military officers thankfully listen to dr wald and that that ended up saving a lot of lives so with that in mind what can we take away from this story well first of all while statistics are important i mean statistics are definitely important without being able to look at the patterns of bullet holes on that plane i mean dr wald wouldn't have been able to come to any conclusions but what's even more important than the statistics themselves is the act of correctly interpreting them and the reason for that is one small oversight right you can understand 90 of the problem perfectly correctly but one little oversight like in this case the fact that the planes that dr world got to see or not the entire sample of planes that have gone into combat one little oversight can lead to a giant mistake not only you know understanding ninety percent of the problem makes me makes your answer ninety percent correct uh in fact you could get the complete wrong answer where you would have actually been better off if you never saw any data in the first place because that one oversight would have led to dr walt tell the officers to put the body armor in exactly the wrong place so that brings me to the framework that we're going to use for interpreting statistics this is kind of a general framework um that's going to be mentioned throughout this webinar it's called causal inference causal just means cause and effect that's all it means inference is the act of figuring something out so if you put it together causal inference is the act of figuring out why statistics are the way they are that's exactly what dr walt did that's exactly what we're going to do going forward now at the beginning of every talk that i give uh i like to start with a promise not necessarily a big promise even just a little promise but something that i say in this talk you're going to be able to take away from it something that's going to change the way you look at something going forward and because this is kind of you know a special talk i'm actually going to make two promises the first promise is that something i say at some point in this talk is going to ensure that coming out of this whether it's in tennis as coaches or whether it's even in the world outside of tennis you will never quite look at statistics the same way again as for the second promise i'm gonna save that one for the end of the webinar so i'll keep being suspense without further ado let's get into the tennis so how effective is playing the net really you know whenever whenever i learn something i always find that it's easier to learn by an example rather than just throw a bunch of terms and definitions at you without context oftentimes it's just easier to convey it through an example so that's exactly what i'm going to do here i'm going to convey how to use causal inference through an example this example is how effective is playing the net as opposed to staying back at the baseline as far as what i mean by effective well you know in the words of the former new york jets head coach herm edwards you play to win the game and as a result what i'm looking at is is first thing i'm going to look at anyway is wind probabilities playing the net staying back at the baseline got7 probabilities here these are from a publicly available online article by craig o'shannessy the strategy coach uh he got data from the atp on the left side and the wta tours on the right side this is from 2002 to 2015. and if you notice it's very consistent across both tours and years uh players tend to win 65 66 of the time when they approach the net uh they tend to win only 45 46 of the time when they stay back at the baseline so this is this is something that is extremely consistent and the way that craig o'shannessy interprets it this is a quote that's that's taken from his article he says it's it's a really easy straightforward question uh do you want to play more points back at the baseline where your win probability is 46 or less than that uh or do you want to develop your net game to create a larger group of points for yourself where you can win 65-66 of the time and he concludes by saying it's a no-brainer or is it and it seemed like a no-brainer that um you know with dr wall that the armor goes where the bullet holes are and yet it temple uh people either this was kind of a hypothetical scenario before i get into a formal match analysis this is just a hypothetical scenario imagine that somehow i've been morphed into this world-class tennis player and i am playing novak djokovic i serve four points to him the first two points are like the one on the left here right some great serves djokovic floats two returns barely gets those things back i approach the net so you know i got this nice floated return i approached the nap put away a couple volleys i win both points my win probability is 100 the other two djokovic as you can see on the right hits much stronger returns he blasts the map i'm not approaching that on these i'm staying back playing some defense and since i'm a good grinder i managed to grind out one of the two points and i end up with a 50 win probability so with that in mind i mean i do have 100 one probability of than that and a fifty percent win probability one staying back should i have approached more often right was coming to net actually a more effective tactic than staying back well causal inference let me ask myself why are the statistics in this case the wps or wind probabilities and throughout this uh presentation i'm going to abbreviate wind probabilities as wps why are the wind probabilities the way they are well it really comes down to the quality of the incoming ball even more so right than the fact that i happened to approach the net on the two points that i won what really mattered here was not so much the act of approaching the net what really mattered was the quality of the incoming ball and therefore i really shouldn't have approached more often because if you think about it if i did approach more often i would have had to try to approach the net on a return that was blasted at me i probably would have lost both those points trying to come in on blasted returns so in fact if i just compared the win probabilities and decided that i should approach more often i probably would have won fewer points which means that in general having a higher wind probability at net does not necessarily mean that you should approach the net more often and i'll repeat that a higher wind probability at net doesn't necessarily mean that you should approach the net more often so now i'm going to do a formal match analysis so that was just a hypothetical scenario no real data or numbers i'm going to start giving some numbers here this is this is a match that i analyzed i charted it by hand i bought a dvd of the match kind of see it here um this is the 2016 wimbledon final uh andy murray versus milos raonic uh murray won this match six four seven six seven six to one a second wimbledon title what's great about this match the reason why i chose it is because of the great contrast and styles right murray is this you know this steady counter puncher or as rounded just the attacking player with the big serve and the big forehand so it was just nice to get a contrast to styles but what i'm going to do is i'm going to formally analyze this match in terms of how effective is playing the net really before i do that though um confounders confounders are a statistical term all right that i'm going to i'm going to introduce here this is not a tennis term this is a statistical term and what are confounders so confounders first of all are variables um other than approaching the nap so confounders i mean approaching those its own variable confounders are something else that has two key properties the first property is that confounders affect your odds of winning the point so it's it's something that happens some variable over the course of the point that does in fact just like approaching the net can affect your odds of winning the point a confounder can affect your odds of winning the point it also affects your odds of approaching the net right just like the quality of those returns in the djokovic scenario right having a floated return definitely impacts your odds of winning the point it also impacts your odds of approaching the net because you're more likely to come in on a floated ball examples of confounders these are kind of the three basic confounders i'm going to use when i really get into the murray roundage match the depth direction and speed of the incoming ball so the depth is just did it land short or deep or did it land inside the service line or past it the direction as in was it in the center of the court was it centered or was it hitting the corners and lastly the speed essentially was it hit hard or was it floated uh and the thing with confounders is i mean they're called confounders because the confound is to confuse and they can confuse you um like with dr walrut the confounder there was that you have a situation where not all the planes that uh dr walt um essentially that dr wool did not get to see all the planes that went into combat so in this case the point is is that when you have confounders that affect both your odds of winning the point and your odds of approaching the net they can confuse you and cause you to draw the wrong conclusions so when i set up this analysis um first thing i always do right whenever i'm setting up any sort of statistical analysis which is exactly what i'm about to do here for the murray roundage match i ask myself a question i have to define the problem the problem here is is approaching the net better than staying back that's the question the sample this is the the statistical sample i'm going to use and the data it's every rally shot not not every point right every shot within every point so it's a bigger sample uh every rally shop in other words no serves no returns because throwing serves and returns in there would just make it even more confusing i don't i don't want to make it too confusing here um with both players back i don't want a situation where one player is already at the net because one player is already at the net then he can't be approaching that because he's already there um so the question is approaching better than staying back sample every rally shot with both players currently back at the baseline having the opportunity to approach if they so choose the independent variable the independent variables like the main variable the one that we really care about um in this case that's approaching the net the dependent variable it's not just these are just uh more statistical terms a dependent variable is what depends on the independent variables the dependent variable here is winning the point the point is is that winning the point depends on whether you approach the net that's why we're looking at when probabilities here and lastly the confounders i'm going to throw the confounders into this analysis too because i have to account for them depth direction speed of the incoming ball the same three confounders that i just discussed a couple of minutes ago now my intuition the way that i expect this to play out here so i want to kind of go into this analysis with a well-defined hypothesis fact one pros just like murray and ramich tend to approach on confounders right when you get a shortfall when you get a centered ball when you get a floated ball these are all incoming balls coming at you yet anything like that you are more likely to approach than that than if you got a different type of incoming ball in addition you are more likely to win the point when you get a ball that is short-centered or floated regardless of whether you approach or not or if you get an easy ball like that regardless of what decision you make in terms of approaching the net you have an increased likelihood of winning the point and as a result if you put those two facts together what i expect to say is that confounders are deceptively inflating players win probabilities at now because the point is is that you tend to approach the net when you get an easy ball and it's the easy ball that may be helping you win the point rather than the act of approaching and yet if you don't account for the confounders you can't see the difference between those two phenomenons in the data so now gonna look at the data so i'm gonna throw some numbers uh action the next slide here uh these are summary statistics um for when i charted this match so if you look at the left column this is all for andy murray if you look at the right column this is all from milos raonic uh what we see here is that murray hit 185 rally shots rownich hit 206 rally shots now roundish's number is higher because rounds is the more aggressive player which means that points generally tend to end for better or worse on roundabout shots he oftentimes gets the last shot in the rally whether it's around hitting a winner or round it's making an error um roundish does typically get the last shot which is why his number here is higher what you see for instance is that on 104 out of murray's 185 rally shots 56 of the time he went on to win the point doesn't mean that murray 104 points it means that out of murray's 185 rally shots that we're looking at here he went on to win the point 104 times uh roundish on the on the other hand was 98 for 206 his percentage is a little bit smaller because he lost this match you look at approaches so out of murray's 185 rally shots on 17 of the 9 9 of the time murray approached the net raunch's approach rate was actually much higher uh the reason being that he really can't compete with andy murray from the baseline so he came in 25 of his opportunities and these are the confounders so when is the dependent variable approach is the main independent variable and then you got these three confounders short centered floated uh these three confounders are the equality of the incoming ball so for instance here when i say 85 out of 185 for murray were centered this is not murray hitting 85 centered balls to roundage this is of the 185 shots that murray had coming at him um you know where he eventually hit a rally shot um 85 were centered so 85 of the incoming balls that murray faced were centered um roundage 76 of the 206 incoming balls that round each face were centered then you know same thing for short and floated so i'm going to take this data now and i'm going to do the statistical analysis on and the type of statistical analysis i'm going to do to answer the main question whether approaching the net is better than staying back right that is that is the main question so that's what we keep coming back to i'm going to use a statistical technique called uh regression so the purpose of regression it's again it's a statistical technique it is used to model how independent variables affect dependent variables um so in this case if you want if you want to figure out how does approaching the net affect your odds of winning the point a regression is a great statistical technique for this because it's designed so that it can account for confounders or just comparing raw win probabilities can't account for confounders regression analysis can so we are applying regressions to our main question of trying to figure out what is the impact that approaching the net has on you winning the point and i'm going to run two regressions on two of them for each player so technically it's four total but it's two regressions for each player the first regression is gonna have no confounders just gonna ignore the confounders pretend they don't exist so it's just gonna be approaching that and winning the point and actually this is the exact same thing as calculating rolling probabilities i mean the method's a little bit different but you end up getting the exact same numbers as if you just calculated the raw win probabilities the way craig oshannassy did um earlier in the webinar the second regression for each player is going to be the one with the confounders so we're going to throw short centered and float it in there um and what's going to happen is we're going to try to figure out is approaching the net's impact gonna be smaller in regression two because regression two is accounting for the phenomenon that these confounders could be deceptively inflating raw wind probabilities now this doesn't mean it's gonna be a situation where all of a sudden regression 2 approaching that is going to look like a bad tactic right that's not necessarily the case at all um it might still be a very good tactic i'm just expecting the impact to be smaller maybe that in regression one the impact looks really great and big and that approaching the net is this this awesome tactic and maybe it's still a good one but not quite as good um this is a regression table this is pretty much the most uh you know the most involved slide in this entire presentation it's got a lot of numbers um so i'm just going to kind of take you through it um so if you look at the left hand column here what you're going to see are the variables so we see approach we see the short centered floated variables and we see this thing called constant so constant this is not a tennis term constant is a statistical term okay so if we look at the murray regressions so again there's 185 if you remember a couple slides back um murray 105 185 rally shots so what we see we're just going to look at regression one for murray the one with no confounders it was just constant and approach so the definition of constant i'm going to say this a couple of times the definition of constant is it is a player's win probability when none of the other variables in the regression are true so i'm going to say that again constant is the player's win probability when none of the other variables that are in the regression are true so in the regression with no confounders the only variable that's in this regression is approach a short centered floated not even here so constant this 53 percent number is just murray's one probability when approach is not true so it's just murray's one probability when he stays back that's all it is murray's one probability when he stayed back is 53 now the second number here for approach this 35.3 percent number what's going on with that well this 35.3 percent number this is not murray's win probability when he approached the net this is the benefit that murray got from approaching the net he got a 35.3 benefit though this may not be an accurate benefit this is just the kind of raw wind probability benefit so all it means is that if you want to figure out what murray's one probability was when he approached the net just add these two numbers just add 53 and 35.3 percent so murray's win probability at net was 88.3 percent so his one probability staying back was 53 percent is one probability approaching the net was 88.3 percent you might be wondering why am i doing it this way why didn't i just report 53 here and 88.3 percent theirs i mean those are the raw win probabilities why not just report it like that that would probably be simpler uh the reason why is because in this second regression here the one where the confounders get thrown into the mix um all of a sudden actually is a lot easier to present it this way um because if you look here write this 45 percent number now if you remember the definition of constant is just the player's one probability when none of the other variables in the regression are true so this 45 percent number is murray's one probability when he doesn't approach someone approach is not true and when the incoming ball is not short and when the incoming ball is not centered and when the incoming ball is not floated so this 45 percent number is murray's win probability when he stays back and the incoming ball is neither short nor centered nor floated and that's why this 45 number is smaller than this 53 percent number because this is just the 53 is just murray's one probability when he stays back now this is the 45 percent number is murray's one probability when he stays back and he's not getting an easy ball um because the thing is right short that's that's positive this percentage is positive murray has a benefits to receiving a shortfall there is a you know benefit when murray gets a short bone there's a benefit when murray gets a centered ball there's a benefit when murray gets a floated ball um all these three things increase murray's odds of winning the point um all these numbers aside from constant are the benefit numbers um and the key thing to notice here and this is this is like the if you're going to take anything out of looking at this table the key thing to notice here are the the numbers in bold uh we can compare the numbers in bold so 35.3 percent is the increase in murray's raw win probability when it comes to nat this 22.2 is the more accurate benefit to murray approaching um in other words the 22.2 percent is the number when you're accounting for the confounder so the 35.3 number is deceptively high a 22.2 number is the more accurate one and if you look at the the same same exact thing for milos raonic here um it appears that his his uh benefit to approaching the net is 22.8 percent in reality the benefit is more like 16.4 when we look at these confounders uh and of course i could totally add more confounders to this right these these are just kind of three of the more basic confounders but they're going to be others i mean the height of the incoming ball the spin that's on the incoming ball i mean there are tons more even whether it was hit to his forehand or his backhand there are tons more confounders and the more confounders you add uh the more that the true benefit of the calculated true benefit of approaching the net actually goes down um so what we see here overall is that it is in fact the case that the players win probability when they approach the net is deceptively high just kind of reiterate the numbers murray had a 53 win probability staying back 88.3 win probability probability approaching so his win probability when approaching was 35.3 percent higher as you could see is one probability when approaching was 35.3 percent higher and yet a more accurate estimate of how effective approaching actually was for him was just 22.2 percent more effective brownish um same story 41.9 percent win probability staying back 64.7 percent win probability approaching so the win probability when approaching was 22.8 that is that number here and yet the more accurate number the more accurate actual benefit that roundage had for approaching was just 16.4 so what you can see again is that uh because of the confounders that if you don't account for the confounders um that wind probability that you you try to estimate uh for approaching the net becomes deceptively high so some takeaways from this from this section of the webinar some takeaways involving uh approaching the net so first of all again can founders deceptively inflate the win probability that players have when they approach the net you can see that in the numbers that is that is in fact what's going on um and as a result right if you generalize this um in theory all right well it was not the case in this match um but in theory you could have a match where a player has a higher win probability at net and yet should approach less often it was i mean if you if you remember the hypothetical scenario with djokovic uh with you know the four returns two of them were floated i came into that on both won both points two of them were hammered um i stayed back i won one of the two points so that was a situation where i had a higher win probability when approaching and yet if i'd approached more often i actually would have been worse off um so in theory you actually can have a match and later in the webinar actually it's not going to be for approaching the net but there is in fact actually a match where something like this really happens we have a higher win probability doing something and you actually should do it less often um so now i'm going to get into some further applications of causal inference so approaching the net that was that was one application of causal influence again causal inference is just that statistical term that means figuring out why statistics are the way they are causal cause and effect inference figuring something out figuring out why the statistics are the way they are uh the next application i'm going to give um hitting down the middle you can see the picture here you know murray's been kind of pulled off the court he's preparing uh to hit it down the middle um round which is already kind of anticipating that um now down the middle is actually kind of the opposite of approaching that approaching the net is an offensive tactic hitting down the middle is a defensive attack you generally get down the middle when you're on the defensive so what we actually may see is kind of the opposite phenomenon taking place right where hitting down the middle might have a deceptively low wind probability um so i'm gonna i'm gonna run through the same analysis this is the exact same format this is once again it's a regression analysis the only difference here is that instead of looking at approaching the net we're just looking at hitting down the middle uh dtm is down the middle so the question is is hitting down the middle worse than hitting to the corners um once again the exact same statistical sample so it's every rally shot that murray and roundage hit no serves no returns and both players are back at the baseline i'm not even gonna present a table of summary statistics because the tables would virtually be the same again it's 185 rally shots for murray 206 rally shots for roundage the independent variable in this case the main one that we care about instead of approaching the net now it's hitting down the middle the dependent variable which is what depends what's called dependent it's what depends on the independent variable is one of the points we're trying to figure out well what is the impact depending down the middle on on winning the point and the confounders are the same uh same exact confounders you have the depth the direction and the speed of the incoming ball it's your short center floated um again there could be more confounders if you really want to break it down even further just for the purpose of this we're just going to stick with these uh with these confounders so my intuition here again just just like i did with approaching the net i need to formulate a clear hypothesis before i look at the data fact one pros generally don't hit down the middle on confounders i mean if you get a short ball or you get a centered ball or you get a floated ball coming at you you're probably not going to hit down the middle i mean those are those are balls i want to attack on i'm probably going to want to put those in the corners in addition you tend to win on the confounders i tend to win when i get a short-centered floated incoming ball regardless of whether i hit down the middle or not regardless of what i do i get an easy ball probably to win the point so as a result right with approaching the net confounders were deceptively inflating the player's win probabilities what i expect here is that the confounders are going to deceptively deflate the player's win probabilities it should look the opposite so gonna look at the data once again um [Music] regression table this is this is just pretty much the exact same regression table as the previous one the only difference is the numbers are different now because i changed this variable so this is no longer approach this is now hitting down the middle um short centered floated these are the confounders down the middle is the main independent variable we have this constant guy in here once again constant is the player's win probability when none of the other variables in the regression are true so this 59.9 number this is murray's win probability the only other variable in this regression because there's no confounders in this one the only other variable in this regression is metal so 59.9 percent is just murray's win probability when he doesn't hit down the middle um when he does hit down the middle is one probability is 14 percent lower um that's that's a pretty significant drop uh and yeah when you throw the confounders into the mix you see short centered and floated once again you got positive numbers here because if you receive a short ball you receive a centered ball you receive a floated ball you're more likely to win the point and based on the you know the phenomenon that i was that was guessing was going to happen here uh you can see that this negative 9.6 number is not as pronounced as this negative 14 number so murray's win probability when hitting down the middle is 14 percent lower the raw win probability yet the more accurately determined impact it's only 9.6 percent worse same thing for roundish here um you know what appears to be something that's 10.7 percent worse is really only 8.7 percent worse so we take away from this right just just like how approaching that was deceptively inflating the player's win probabilities hitting down the middle is deceptively deflating on the players when probably the confounders are deceptively deflating the player's win probabilities when they hit down the middle so right could we have a match and again it's not this one uh but could we have a match where you have a lower wind probability when you hit down the middle and yet you should actually get down the middle more often and again it can happen because uh just because you have a lower wind probability when you hit down the middle doesn't necessarily mean that hitting down the middle is a bad top that you should do it less often and now this is one specific match this this is like the really cool match where you actually see that crazy phenomenon taking place if something has a higher wind probability or in this case it's a lower wind probability and you should do it more often um this is the 2014 us open women's final this was serena williams beating caroline wozniacki uh also like this match because of the contrast and styles you have the aggressive player and serena williams the defensive player and caroline wallsniaki uh the tactic that i'm looking looking at here is playing behind the baseline something that was the act he did a lot i'm only analyzing well sneaky here no no serena williams analysis uh and what you see here is um uh what's the ackee right her wind probability when she stands behind the baseline is only is uh 6.4 lower uh than her win probability when she's on top of the baseline all right so if you uh look here behind right this just means behind the baseline we have our good friend the constant term um i can only put two confounders in this one i couldn't put a floated confounder in here because apparently when i charted this match serena williams didn't really hit any floaters at caroline wilste because serena is just incredible and she just wasn't hitting any floaters um but what you see is that you have a situation where wozniacki had a 6.4 percent lower win probability when she positioned herself well behind the baseline like you see in this picture and yet when you throw the confounders into the analysis right this is just a situation where she's more likely to win the point when she gets a short or centered incoming ball but when she gets a shorter centered incoming ball she's definitely less likely to be behind the baseline you have a situation where these flap right um it looks like playing behind the baseline is a bad thing and then when you throw the confounders in it flips to being positive now that doesn't mean she should be playing behind the baseline all the time i mean there are definitely certain balls if i broke it down further you know there are definitely certain balls i've got a short ball you definitely want to be inside the baseline but this is essentially a situation where she had a lower wind probability when playing behind the baseline yet in general she actually should have done it slightly more often it was actually a little bit too quick to try to get on top of the baseline um so this is this is kind of the the super most pronounced scenario where she has a lower wind probability playing behind the baseline and yet you should have done it more often uh so i'm just going to run through i'm not going to do any more statistical analyses here i'm just going to run through some additional tactics swinging volleys swinging volleys highly aggressive tactic um players can have really high wind probabilities on swing and volleys as compared to regular volleys doesn't necessarily mean they should swing in volleys more often defensive lobs are the opposite um that's a really defensive tactic so as a result the wind probably hit a defensive lob your wind probability is going to be really really low um but that doesn't mean you shouldn't necessarily be hitting defensive lobs i mean you do it when you basically already lost the point uh so what you're seeing here is that essentially the more offensive a shot is um the more deceptively high it's when probability is going to be uh whereas with defensive shots and if you don't account for confounders their win probabilities tend to be deceptively low um so again i'm going to say that you know one more time the um the more offensive the tactic the more likely it is that the win probability that the player has with the tactic tends to be deceptively high and vice versa the last thing here and this is this is kind of a unique thing serbs serves don't have incoming balls that's why i just i just want to mention them uh briefly serves do not have incoming balls you know returns have incoming balls volleys ground strokes they all have incoming balls serves down right you just toss it hit it um i definitely like this picture of murray serving so i chose chose this one on purpose um but the uh the thing here right with serves because there are no incoming balls this is the one shot where raw wind probabilities really do tell the story um so if you look here right this is actually from the murray roundage match um when berry hit his first serve to the ad court down the t he won 96 percent of the time and yet when he hit his first serve out wide to the uh out wide to the ad court um his win probability was only 40 i mean he didn't do it very often but and again the sample size is kind of small here but it does seem like hitting down the t was more effective than hitting out wide and there's no incoming balls to confound you here however you do have to compare apples to apples one thing you don't want to do is start trying to pull together first serves and second serves in the data because then you could have a situation where um you know a player tends to hit a second serve out wide a lot you know as a result what happens is you know because players have lower wind probabilities on second serves it it suddenly looks like um [Music] uh the um the second the direction that you tend to hit the second serve tends to be a less effective direction even though in reality it's not um so that's kind of pretty much the the framework here would serve serves again no confounders a little bit easier to uh to analyze them so the overall takeaways now if you're if you're going to take anything out of this presentation these are the overall takeaways not just for this section but for for the entire webinar here uh first of all regression analysis is a highly useful uh thing to do right i mean this statistical analysis is really useful it's a great way to quantify um the effects that confounders can have on your data that's a great way you know to see whether one tactic is more effective than another tactic it's it's a more accurate method than just comparing raw wind probabilities i think that it should become mainstream in the tennis analytics community and yet it's not the most important thing um or the regression analysis or any fancy statistical technique is not the most important thing the most important thing is keeping an inquisitive mind but that's more important than any fancy statistical technique that you can come up with um [Music] if you keep an inquisitive mind if you ask yourself when you're looking at the data why are the data the way they are why are the statistics the way they are even if you can't fully quantify it because you don't have that statistical toolkit even if you just ask yourself why is my players win probability in that high why is my players win probability when it hits down the middle low uh that goes a long long way you don't necessarily need the statistical background in fact i can prove it um this is another it's a non-tennis story um just like the dr walt story was a non-tennis story this is a story of a guy who had no statistical background whatsoever i was not a statistician dr walt was a great statistician this guy was not a statistician and yet he in my view conducted the most important uh the most consequential statistical analysis of all time and and he got it right uh it's a story of lieutenant colonel stanislaw uh he was lieutenant colonel in the soviet union in 1983. the soviet union had just installed a new computerized missile defense system that was essentially doing statistical analysis on patterns of light that were in the sky and petrol was the officer tasked with reading the machine and all of a sudden one morning in 1983 um the machine the statistics were basically saying that the united states launched five nuclear missiles at the soviet union and they were incoming um and petrov had to decide do i retaliate i mean do i shoot nuclear missiles at the united states the machine was telling them to do it um and yet petrov instead of just going oh well that's what the statistics show let's let's retaliate he stood back he's like wait what's going on here why are these patterns of light the way they are i mean first of all is the united states crazy and second of all if they were really going to be shooting nuclear missiles at us why would they only shoot five that doesn't make any sense and if if they're only shooting five bissells at us we could totally retaliate on them surely they would shoot a lot more uh so what lieutenant colonel petrov realized is this is probably a false alarm um that something's going on there's some sort of confounder in this case what it was was that um there was a weird cloud formation and the way that light was reflecting off the cloud uh was triggering the machine to have a false alarm and as a result because petrov he thought you know why are the data the way they are he interpreted the statistics correctly and the guy literally saved the world and he's he's the reason why we're all you know why we're all here today um now now fortunately i fortunately as tennis coaches um we do not have the fate of the entire planet on our shoulders um and yeah and this this is the second promise right this is the second promise uh the first promise uh which i gave you know earlier in the talk about how you're never going to look at statistics the same way again this is my second promise [Music] which is that whether you have statistical training or not um if you keep an inquisitive mind if you ask yourself why are the statistics the way they are um then as tennis coaches you are going to be you are going to be able to provide the best possible service for your players um and really i mean providing uh you know providing the best possible service for your players is is what being in tennis coaches is all about
